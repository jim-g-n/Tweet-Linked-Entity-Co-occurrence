# Tweet-Linked-Entity-Co-occurrence

The 'dataset' folder includes the tweet IDs split into two files and list of search keywords. These keywords were chosen by Mark Dang-Anh, Giorgia Riboni, and Dimitar Dimitrov as part of a bigger initiative to create a comprehensive dataset about nationalism during COVID-19 in English, German, and Italian. 

The created graph-tool graphs and their associated data (mapping of entities to nodes) are in the 'created_graphs' folder. The scripts used to create and analysis the graphs are in the 'scripts' folder.
